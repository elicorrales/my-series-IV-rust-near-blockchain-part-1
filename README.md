We go into more detail in the Part 3 video of : [Series I - NEAR Blockchain Tutorial](https://github.com/elicorrales/blockchain-tutorials/blob/main/README.md#series-i---near-blockchain-tutorial-deploying-wasm)

Perhaps either create an Bash ```alias```, or a global ```export```.  I chose an alias.  
In ```~/.bashrc```, near bottom, I added:  
```
alias localnear="NEAR_ENV=localnet;near";
```
  
The above distinguishes the command I would run when deploying to local node vs deploying to testnet.  
  

```
localnear deploy --accountId mynearlocalwallet.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rust-counter-tutorial-bin-lib.wasm
```
